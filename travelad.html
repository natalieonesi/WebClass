	<p> <b> Here are some personal reviews of people who took a trip to Delphi: </b> </p> 
	
	<p> <i> "Delphi was full of history and culture. It was honestly worth ever dollar to go
	because it wasn't just a trip for relaxing or a trip to go sight seeing, it was the 
	perfect mix of both." </i> <b> - Jasmine, from Arizona </b> </p>
	
	<p> <i> "I went to Delphi last June and it was magical. I spent a lot of time outdoors, 
	but it was different than what I was used to at home. The landscapes were rolling, and 
	beautiful. The hikes that Panda Travel Agency offers in groups takes you to some of 
	the most beautiful hidden places in Greece!" </i> <b> Annmarie, from Alabama </b> </p>
	
	<p> <i> "When I went to Delphi, I felt like I was able to step outside of all modern
	life and go back into the history of thousands of years ago. One thing I noticed was how 
	little I ever thought about being on my phone. I even left it at the hotel by accident 
	one day, and didn't notice until I got back after sightseeing! The tours that Panda 
	Travel Agency really help you get an in depth look into the details that might have 
	been passed over in the history textbooks" </i> <b> Abby, from Tennessee </b> </p> <hr />
