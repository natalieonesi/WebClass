		<h1> What is a Mediterranean Monk Seal? </h1>
		<img class="image1" src="img3.jpg" alt="main picture"/>
			<p> Known often as a "living fossil", the Mediterranean Monk Seal dates as far
			back as 15 million years. Sadly, it is one of the many species that is endangered 
			and not enough is being done about this problem. Once heavily present in the 
			Mediterranean and a similar species in the Indian Ocean and off the coasts of Hawaii, 
			the Mediterranean Monk Seal now survives in low numbers.  </p>
		
		<h2> Causes of Extinction </h2>
			<p> Like any other animal going extinct, the Mediterranean Monk Seal shares some 
			of the same reasons for extinction. Some things are: hunting, pollution, and disturbance by humans. 
			In reference to pollution, the biggest culprit of this is human waste. One article even says, 
			"Even after an 18 year clean up effort, still only 30% of the Mediterranean Monk Seal's coastal towns
			and cities had sewage treatment plants by 1993." People today do not realize that the small actions 
			they do on a day to day basis affect the lives and longevity of creatures like these. Outside of waste, 
			humans are also disturbing the general environment. These seals are naturally very shy creatures but with 
			more humans invading their homes, they grow frightened. There is an increase in boat traffic, overfishing, 
			and beach use. This causes them to not come to shore as much for fear of the humans and they stay far away 
			making it harder for them to hunt their prey. Humans also set up net fisheries to catch other types of 
			fish for selling, but in reality some of them injure or drown monk seals, causing a dramatic drop in 
			the population. </p>

		<h3> Conservation </h3>
			<img class="image6" src="map.gif" alt="Distribution of Remaining Population Map"/> <!--float right-->
			<p2> The <b> International Union for the Conservation of Nature </b> classified Mediterranean
			Monk Seal as endangered first in 1966. Since then, they have tried to create some protected areas
			for the monk seals to be able to come to shore and eat their prey. There has also been some 
			research done with tagging and monitoring their lives in the wild. While there is some 
			disagreement, another way some biologists think they can conserve the species is to force breeding 
			in captivity. There is some dispute about this because some say that in the past, the seals have not
			bred well or survived well in captivity. </p2>
