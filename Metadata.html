		<p> Music is a very important part of life that can have a lasting impact on many 
		people. A famous quote says, "Where words fail, music speaks." </p>

				<figcaption> My favorite song of all time is <q> Vienna </q> by Billy Joel. It pretty much describes
				everything I struggle with and it was nice to find a song that puts exactly how I 
				feel into words that I could not have found myself. </figcaption>

		<figure> <!--Image of Wake me Up When September Ends-->
			<img src="september.jpeg" alt="Wake Me Up When September Ends"/>
				<figcaption> <q> Wake Me up When September Ends </q> is a very inspirational song to me because
				it really helped me realize that a lot of people are in similar situations that I am in. 
				It really showed me the power that music has to make people feel less 
				alone in the things they are struggling with. </figcaption>

		<figure> <!--Image of Here Comes the Sun-->

				<figcaption> <q> Here Comes the Sun </q> is such a beautiful song. It always 
				puts me in a good mood because there it reminds me that no matter what is 
				happening something good is just on the horizon. I also love the sound 
				of pretty much every Beatles song.</figcaption>
