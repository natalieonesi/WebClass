		<h3> Shirley Jackson </h3> <!--Biography section-->

			<p5> Shirley Jackson is a theoretical physicist best known for her advancements 
			in telecommunications. She had an influence on things such as: the portable fax, touch 
			tone telephone, solar cells, fiber optic cables, and the technology behind caller ID 
			and call waiting while conducting research at <a href="http://www.belllabs.com"> Bell Laboratories </a> </p5> <br /> <br />
			
			
			<p6> Shirley Jackson is someone you look at in history that you know took one of those
			major steps forward. She studied for her bachelor and doctoral degree in physics 
			at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and went on to become the first African 
			American women to earn a Ph.D. from MIT in any subject, as well as one of the first
			two black women to receive a doctorate in physics in the US. </p6> <br /> <br />
			
			<p7> She is looked at as one of the most influential role models in the history 
			of science because of her willingness to overcome gender and racial bias that still 
			separated her field at the start of her career. She has won many awards, 
			including The Medal of Science from former President Barack Obama, but what has made 
			her legendary is not the money or recognition she has received, but the persistance she displayed. 
			She basically had the world against her because she was a woman of color, but she goes
			to display that suppressing people because of their gender or race is what will hold 
			back advancements of society, as shown in her own advancements of the field of telecommunications. 
			Dr. Jackson is often called the <a href="https://iq.intel.com/dr-shirley-ann-jackson-ultimate-role-model-science/"> ultimate role model of science. </a>
